Cypress Project Documentation
This document describes how to set up and run the tests for this project using Cypress, a next generation front end testing tool.

Prerequisites
Before you can run the tests, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

•  Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run the tests. You can download it from herehttps://docs.cypress.io/.

•  Cypress: The testing framework that provides a fast, easy and reliable way to test anything that runs in a browser. You can install it using the command npm install cypress --save-dev in your project folder.

•  TypeScript (optional): A superset of JavaScript that adds optional types and other features. You can use TypeScript to write your tests if you prefer. You can install it using the command npm install typescript --save-dev in your project folder. You also need to add a tsconfig.json file to configure TypeScript. You can see an example of this file herehttps://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration.

Running the tests
To run the tests, you need to open the Cypress Test Runner, which is a graphical user interface that allows you to see the tests in action, view the results and debug the failures. You can open the Test Runner using the command npx cypress open in your project folder. This will launch a window where you can select the tests you want to run.

You can also run the tests in headless mode, which means they will run in the background without opening a browser window. This is useful for continuous integration or automation purposes. You can run the tests in headless mode using the command npx cypress run in your project folder. This will output the results in the terminal.

Test structure
The tests are located in the cypress/e2e folder by default, but you can configure it to another location using the cypress.config.js file. You can see an example of this file [here].

The tests are organized in spec files, which are files that end with .spec.js, .spec.ts, .spec.jsx or .spec.tsx. Each spec file can contain one or more tests, which are defined using the it or specify function. You can also group your tests using the describe or context function, which creates a suite of tests that share a common description.

You can use the cypress/support folder to store any code that you want to run before every test, such as custom commands, plugins or configuration options. You can see an example of a custom command file [here].

Test tools
In addition to the built-in commands and assertions that Cypress provides, you can also use the following tools to enhance your testing experience:

•  Xpath: A library that allows you to locate elements using XPath expressions, which are a syntax for defining parts of an XML document. You can install it using the command npm install -D cypress-xpath in your project folder. You also need to import it in your cypress/support/e2e.js file using the statement require('cypress-xpath'). You can see an example of how to use Xpath [here].

•  Cypress-mochawesome-reporter: A custom reporter for Cypress that generates HTML reports with screenshots of the failed tests. You can install it using the command npm install --save-dev cypress-mochawesome-reporter in your project folder. You also need to change the reporter in your cypress.config.js file using the statement "reporter": "cypress-mochawesome-reporter" and add a hook in your cypress/support/e2e.js file using the statement require('cypress-mochawesome-reporter/register'). You can see an example of how to use Cypress-mochawesome-reporter [here].

More information
For more information about Cypress, you can visit the official documentation [here], where you can find guides, tutorials, examples and references for all the features and functionalities that Cypress offers. You can also join the Cypress community [here], where you can ask questions, share feedback, report issues and contribute to the project.
